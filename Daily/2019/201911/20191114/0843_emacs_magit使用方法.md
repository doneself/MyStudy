## Crash course

Getting started with Magit is really easy:

*   `M-x magit-status` to see git status, and in the status buffer:
*   `s` to stage files
*   `c c` to commit (type the message then `C-c C-c` to actually commit)
*   `b b` to switch to another branch

Other handy keys:

*   `P u` to do a git push
*   `F u` to do a git pull
*   try to press `TAB`
